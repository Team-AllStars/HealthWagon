HealthWagon was developed within 24 hours for K!hacks and achieved a top 5 ranking out of thousands of submissions.

## Problem Statement
Streamlining healthcare information management solutions for prompt and secure patient care.

## Modules

### Fall Detection and Emergency Alert System
- **Mobile Application**: Integrated with a custom Fall Detection Algorithm, it automatically alerts hospitals for an ambulance and notifies emergency contacts when a fall is detected, and the user fails to respond to prompts. This reduces response time and potentially saves lives.

### Ambulance Personnel Mobile App
- **QR Code Scanning**: Ambulance personnel can scan a QR code on the user's phone to access health records, add notes, and send data to the hospital, streamlining preparations and saving vital time during emergencies.

### Distributed Health Record System (EHR)
- **Patient Data Access**: Doctors can access patient data, including allergies, diagnoses, medications, and insurance via REST API. Patients can also log in to view their information and insurance details.
- **Data Security**: Implemented data-level security, providing different data views to doctors, EMTs, and patients to restrict access.

### AI Chatbot
- **Specialized Assistance**: A fine-tuned AI chatbot provides comprehensive responses solely focused on our application, ensuring efficient, secure, and accurate assistance for users.

### Dedicated Hospital Login
- **SOS Message Access**: Hospitals can access SOS messages, displaying their locations on maps alongside ambulance positions. This enables instant dispatch of ambulances in response to SOS alerts.

### Named Entity Recognition System
- **Critical Report Analysis**: A custom Named Entity Recognition System highlights important entities in doctor reports, such as the name of the drug, frequency of drug intake, disease names, etc., helping users understand doctor reports in detail.

### Security Measures
- **Encryption and Authentication**: Employed state-of-the-art encryption algorithms (such as AES) for data storage, secure HTTPS certificates for data transfer, and implemented two-factor authentication for logins. Hashing techniques are utilized to securely store passwords, ensuring robust data security measures across the system.

## Technology Stack
- **Languages & Tools**: React, React-Native, JavaScript, Python, REST API, AES Encryption, HTTPS, Two-Factor Authentication
